# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‑task until you ask the user for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, follow this sequence:
    - **First**: Run the full test suite (`pytest`, `npm test`, `bin/rails test`, etc.)
    - **Only if all tests pass**: Stage changes (`git add .`)
    - **Clean up**: Remove any temporary files and temporary code before committing
    - **Commit**: Use a descriptive commit message that:
      - Uses conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
      - Summarizes what was accomplished in the parent task
      - Lists key changes and additions
      - References the task number and PRD context
      - **Formats the message as a single-line command using `-m` flags**, e.g.:

        ```
        git commit -m "feat: add payment validation logic" -m "- Validates card type and expiry" -m "- Adds unit tests for edge cases" -m "Related to T123 in PRD"
        ```
  3. Once all the subtasks are marked completed and changes have been committed, mark the **parent task** as completed.
- Stop after each sub‑task and wait for the user's go‑ahead.

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

## Discord Notification Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Send Discord webhook notifications in the following situations:

1. **When a task is completed:**
   - Include project name/path, task number, and summary of what was accomplished
   - Mention test results and commit hash

2. **When a task fails or requires compromise:**
   - Explain the failure reason clearly
   - Propose alternatives (skip, hardcode, simplify, or reduce scope)
   - Wait for user feedback before proceeding

3. **When suggesting a better approach:**
   - Explain why the alternative approach is recommended
   - Provide clear reasoning and benefits
   - Wait for user approval before changing course

### Discord Webhook Configuration

- **Webhook URL:** `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1427182963317276743/LA5OmHXKnGgsRlKOFujd2dfIlpD8vUgoefQRev-jCjd-sWseBJrLVgpAiWaUIk0BsD4b`
- **Character Limit:** 1000 characters maximum - summarize appropriately
- **Message Language:** ALL Discord messages MUST be written in Korean (한글)
- **Message Format:** Always include:
  - Project name or path identifier
  - Current task number and description
  - Status or action required
  - Relevant details (commit hash, test results, error summary, etc.)

### Example Discord Message Format

```json
{
  "content": "**[FIRE]** Task 5.0 완료 ✅\n\n**작업:** 증자/감자 현황 API 구현\n**경로:** /Users/idongho/proj/fire\n**테스트:** 84개 통과, 149 assertions\n**커밋:** 12699a1\n\n모든 서브태스크 완료. 다음 지시 대기 중입니다."
}
```

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update the file and then pause for user approval.
7. **ALWAYS send Discord notifications** as specified in the Discord Notification Requirements section above.
